Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) and discover the key concepts that can help you ace any technical interview.
🌟 Class vs. Object: In OOPs, a class acts as a blueprint, defining the characteristics and behaviors of a particular type of object. On the other hand, an object is an instance of a class, representing a concrete representation with its unique values.
💡Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and its manipulating code into a single unit called an object. It safeguards the data from direct access or modification, enhancing code reusability and maintainability.
🌀 Abstraction: Abstraction enables us to hide the intricate implementation details of an object and expose only its essential features. It allows users to interact with objects without worrying about their internal workings.
🎭 Polymorphism: Polymorphism sets OOPs apart by granting objects the ability to take on different forms. Inheritance and method overriding lay the foundation of polymorphism. Inheritance allows child classes to inherit features and behaviors from their parent class. Method overriding enables derived classes to redefine inherited methods, tailoring them to their specific needs.
⚡️ Dynamic vs. Static Polymorphism: Dynamic polymorphism is resolved at runtime, whereas static polymorphism is resolved at compile time. Method overloading fuels static polymorphism by providing multiple method signatures with different parameters. On the other hand, dynamic polymorphism utilizes method overriding, where the actual behavior is determined by the runtime type of the object.
🔗 A Journey of Inheritance: It comes in three main types:
Single inheritance: A child class inherits from a single parent class.
Multiple inheritance: A child class can inherit from multiple parent classes.
Hierarchical inheritance: Classes can have an inheritance tree, where a class inherits from another class which, in turn, can inherit from another class.
🌌 Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly. They are designed to be inherited by other classes, which can then be instantiated. Abstract classes define common functionality for related classes. Interfaces, on the other hand, are similar to abstract classes but only contain method definitions.
🛠️ Exception Handling: Exception handling plays a crucial role in OOPs. It is the process of gracefully handling errors during program execution. With OOPs, we employ try/catch blocks to manage exceptions. The try block contains code that could potentially cause an error, while the catch block handles and resolves any occurred exceptions.
