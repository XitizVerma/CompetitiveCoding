This version introduces generational capability to ZGC. Previously, all objects were treated equally during collection,
creating potential performance bottlenecks for younger, livelier objects. Now, ZGC categorizes objects into generations
based on their age, allowing faster collection of older generations without impacting younger ones.

ZGC's Algorithms:

Mark-Sweep: The foundation of ZGC, identifying reachable objects and reclaiming memory from unreachable ones.
Read Barrier: Enables accurate marking by tracking references created during collection.
Concurrent Sweeping: Sweeps unreachable memory concurrently with application execution, minimizing pauses.
Coloring: Used in the generational aspect, classifying objects based on their age for more efficient collection.
