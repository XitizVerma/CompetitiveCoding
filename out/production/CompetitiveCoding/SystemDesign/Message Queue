Rabbit MQ

Exchange -
Receives messages from Producer and pushes them into queue depending upon rules defined by the exchange type. A queue must be bound to at least one exchange in order to receive messages.

Bindings -
Bindings are rules that exchanges use to route messages to queues

Routing Key -
A key that the exchange uses to decide how to route the messages to queue

Steps -
Producer publishes messages to exchange via a channel established between them at the time of application startup.
Exchange receives the message and finds appropriate bindings based on message attributes and exchange types.
Selected binding is then used to route messages to intended queues.
The message stays in the queue until handled by the consumer.
Consumers receive the messages using channels established usually at application startup.
