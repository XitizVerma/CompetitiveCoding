Sharding

Sharding is a way to break down databases (Data distribute) into small segments for effective retrieval and scalability.
Sharding is done based on partioning key - Good shard key(orgId)

MongoS is the router that routes the document to specific database server
Types of sharding -
1. Range Based Sharding - partionKey -> A-J, J-S, S-Z
2. Hashed Sharding - hashFunction(partioninKey) = Shard A, Shard B
3. Directory Sharding - red Colour - Shard A, blue Colour - Shard B
4. Geo Sharding - Dating Site - can shard different users based on their locations - Like city as partioning key



Replication

Duplication of data to multiple servers
Copying of data from one node to another or the synchronization of states between nodes.

                        Primary Node
                       /             \                  (asynchronously)
                 Replica 1          Replica 2

Fault Tolerance is directly proportional to Availability.
A machine with good fault tolerance is highly available.
Distributed System (microservices) is more fault tolerance and available than monolithic architecture
as it contains no single point of failure.
