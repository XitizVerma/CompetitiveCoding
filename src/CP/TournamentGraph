Tournament Graph

A Directed complete graph with n vertices
Each pair of vertices have only one edge between them and is directed
This way it has nC2 edges = n(n-1)/2

Number of ways we can design this graph is 2^(nC2)

Transitive Tournament Graph
a<b
b<c
=> a<c according to transitive property
Transitive Graph cannot have cycles and vice versa
All the OutDegree in Transitive Graph are from 0 to n-1;
Similarly the InDegree in Transitive Graph are from 0 to n-1;
