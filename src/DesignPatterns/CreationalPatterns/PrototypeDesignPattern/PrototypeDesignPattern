Prototype Design Pattern

The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch,
because creating a new object may be costly, (when object creation is a heavy process).

Implementing clonable interface to clone objects faster.
Concept of Shallow Cloning and Deep Cloning (nested looping)
